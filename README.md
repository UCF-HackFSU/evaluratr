Car depreciation and parts reliability

<b>Update:<b/>

It was down to the wire, but we were unable to finish in time to present in the HackFSU hackathon.

<i>What we learned...<i/>
+ Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance (The 7 P's). We walked into the hackathon with an idea and an untested API. Big mistake!
+ Eclipse and Android Studio do not like each other.
+ HTTP Requests are actually pretty simple
+ Android Fragments are simple to implement and look really nice

Over all, this project was a great learning experience for every one in the team. We would like to pick this up where we left off a some point in time. However, developement will slow down due to the hackathon being over. That being said we look forward to picking this up in the future!
